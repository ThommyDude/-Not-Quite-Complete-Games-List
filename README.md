# Steam Games List
This is step 1 of a larger idea/project I'm trying to make, final product should be a "complete" games list, getting games from Steam, GOG and Uplay all in one list!

## Demo Link
[Here is a link to my own personal page with my personal games list.](http://thomas.vanderven.se/games)

## What's there?
Currently if you input a Steam webAPI key and a Steam64 ID into the config.php file (found in the config folder) the page will generate a list of all games (Not including games with Beta and/or Test in their name).

_*Update #1*_
Now also showing the 3 last played games in order of most to least playtime of the last 2 weeks.
I'm suprised by the fact that there isn't just a "lastplayed" entry holding the date and/or a timestamp so you could actually order them in order of playing them, instead of just the amount of time... Valve should really get on that!

### So why?
Mainly just to see if I could, and getting some experience working a bit more with API's created by other people.

##### Also dude, why does it look like shit?
First off, fuck you. Second, I'm a functional guy, I don't care much about how it looks. I used bootstrap to at least make it presentable... :wink::ok_hand:
